chromenavigator
===============

Fork of Chrome List by Gijs Kruitbosch. It shows the chrome directory structure
in an XUL application.

This is useful if you are working in add-on development.

In order to build, simply run the build.sh script for *nix systems, or the
build.bat batch file for Windows systems. Alternatively you can just zip up all
the files here into an .xpi package.
